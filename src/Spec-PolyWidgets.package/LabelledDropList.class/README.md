I am a LabelledContainer specialized to manage a DropListModel.
See LabelledContainer

self example

I provide the accessor dropList to be more intuitive than subwidget.

I provide shortcuts for the most common methods of the droplist api to avoid the use of the DoesNotUnderstand or the writing of long chain of accessors.
