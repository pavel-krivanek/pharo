I am a LabelledContainer specialized to manage a InputTextDropList.
See LabelledContainer

self example

I provide the accessors inputTextDropList to be more intuitive than subwidget, and the shortcuts input and dropList.

I provide shortcuts for the most common methods to avoid the use of the DoesNotUnderstand or the writing of long chain of accessors.
