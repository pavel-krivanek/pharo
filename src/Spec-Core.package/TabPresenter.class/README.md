I am a spec presenter representing a single tab.

I should not be used without being contained into a TabManagerPresenter.

You can also have a look at TabsExample for another example.

!! #retrievingBlock: warning

If you specify #retrievingBlock: directly, you should also set the ownership of the appropriate. (See TabPresenter>>#model:)
